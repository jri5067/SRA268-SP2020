I chose to plot the levels of precipitation in 2017 (January only). I set Inches as the Y value plotted Day/Date (1-31) as the X value. "

Regarding the graph, it is clear from the visualization that on days 4, 11, 12, 13, and 24, there were outliers in the data (revealing an influx of precipitation on these days)."
